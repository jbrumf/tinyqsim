## TinyQSim: A Tiny Quantum Simulator

TinyQsim is a tiny quantum circuit simulator based on the quantum gate model.

It was originally started as a fun project to learn about quantum computation and as a framework to explore new ideas. The aim was to 'keep it simple', rather than worrying about optimization. Nevertheless, it is capable of simulating a 20-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform in about one second (tested on a Mac Mini M2). This should make it sufficient for most textbook examples and learning about quantum computing.

Note: TinyQSim should not be confused with the Tiny-Q project that has subsequently appeared in the PyPI software repository with the name TinyQSim. The two are not related.

## Installation

TinyQsim can be downloaded from [https://github.com/jbrumf/tinyqsim](https://github.com/jbrumf/tinyqsim).

For installation instructions, see the README.md file in the source distribution.

## Documentation

The tutorials and examples are also available in the 'examples' directory in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.
